CodeControl is an interactive debugger controlled by custom gestures made to make Computer Science easier, more approachable, and more accessible to beginner students. 
It allows students to step through their code, step-by-step, so they truly understand whatâ€™s happening, without any of the complexities of debugging. In addition to the gesture-controlled debugging, we have a visualizer which shows exactly how the data structures within the code are being manipulated.
